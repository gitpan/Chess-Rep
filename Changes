Revision history for Chess-Rep                          -*- change-log -*-

0.4	Aug 03, 2008
	INCOMPATIBLE changes!  I skipped over 0.3 version number for this
	reason.  The new version uses "0x88 board representation", along
	with other changes that should make speed a lot better (for example,
	pieces are bitwise codified in an integer, rather than a character,
	making it a lot cheaper to do various analysis; see the
	documentation).

	Bugs fixed:

	- supports "O-O-O+" and "O-O+" (rarely seen, but it can happen to
	  check from a castling move).

	- now catches illegal moves where FROM is specified (i.e. "a2e4"
	  from the starting position) -- thanks Ken Takusagawa for the
	  report.

0.2	Apr 26, 2008
	Fixed a nasty bug that caused "e8g8" to be always misinterpreted as
	a O-O, even when another piece than the K was moved

0.1	Apr 04, 2008
	First public release.
