Chess-Rep

A module to represent chess positions and more:

  - generate list of legal moves for the current position
  - parse moves in various notations
  - determine position state (is check? mate? stalemate?)
  - convert current position to FEN at any time
  - reset position from FEN at any time

This module is used in our online chess game at http://chess.dynarch.com/en.html
Come and play, it's all free. ;-)
